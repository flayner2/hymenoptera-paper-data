- `Supplementary_Table_2_Phenotype_data.ods`: eusociality and parasitoidism
  classification data, including references;
- `Supplementary_Table_3_Tree_data.ods`: information used to construct the
  supertree, such as insertion points, including references, and fossil data
  used as calibration points for the MCMCTree analysis, with references;
- `Supplementary_Table_4_IPR_data.ods`: descriptions of all significant,
