This directory contains all the R code used for the analyses in the paper and
for generating the main and supplementary figures. The scripts are:

- `Supplementary_ANOVA.R`: code used for the main analysis of the paper, the
  phylogenetic ANOVA for both eusociality and parasitoidism, and the generation
  of [Figure 3](../../figures/png/Figure_3_IPR_eusociality.png) and 
  [Figure 4](../../figures/png/Figure_4_IPR_parasitoidism.png) of the paper;
- `Supplementary_BUSCO_figure.R`: code used to generate the figures for the
  BUSCO results;
- `Supplementary_Stitched_tree.R`: code used to construct the supertree used as
  a topology constraint for the MCMCTree analysis, as well as generating all
  tree figures, both main and supplementary.
